# Background

Ninety-eight percent of people living with chronic kidney disease stages
4 and 5 not receiving kidney replacement therapy - CKD 4/5 - live with
multiple long-term conditions (1). Resultantly, polypharmacy is highly
prevalent - this group are prescribed on average 8-9 medicines per day
(and \>100 pills per week) (2). Polypharmacy is well linked to avoidable
harms such as falls and hospitalisations (3) so managing it safely is a
key action area within the World Health Organisation’s active global
patient safety challenge: *Medication Without Harm* (4). For people with
CKD 4/5, the risk of medication-related harm is augmented by
unpredictable drug handling and excretion - 1 in 5 experience a
medication-related harm each year (5), making them a high priority group
to study (6). Added to this, clinical trials that establish the safety
and effectiveness of medicines often exclude people living with CKD 4/5,
and do not reflect their comorbidity and diversity (7).

Deprescribing - the systematic process of stopping or reducing
medicines - is a proposed way of reducing the harms associated with
polypharmacy. Within the recently updated KDIGO (Kidney Disease \|
Improving Global Outcomes) CKD practice guideline there is a new chapter
entitled *Medication management and Drug Stewardship*, in which the
authors acknowledge that evidence to guide deprescribing in CKD is
limited (8). Currently there is little guidance for clinicians about
what medicines can be deprescribed and when, and more research into the
effects of deprescribing on clinically-relevant outcomes is needed.

This study will briefly characterise population-level prescribing
patterns for people living with CKD 4/5 in England, and then describe
the patterns of discontinuation of common medicines, going on to
evaluate the clinical and sociodemographic factors that lead to
variances in these patterns.

As an aside, in routine healthcare data, deprescribing is observable as
medication *discontinuation*, so this will therefore be the primary
focus of this study.

# Objectives

1.  To describe patterns of prescribing at a national level for people
    living with advanced CKD
2.  To establish the patterns of discontinuation of common medicines in
    people in England living with advanced CKD.
3.  To identify the clinical and sociodemographic factors associated
    with variances in these patterns.

# Methods

## Study design

We will conduct cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of a
retrospective cohort of individuals living with advanced kidney disease
living in England.

## Data sources

We will analyse the primary care record data of people living in England
that is stored and managed by The Phoenix Partnership (TPP),
specifically through the OpenSAFELY-TPP secure analytical platform. We
will utilise OpenSAFELY-TPP’s established linkages to:

- Office for National Statistics (ONS) data on registered deaths
- NHS Secondary Uses Service data, which includes information regarding
  hospital admissions, and is used to derive each individual’s ethnicity
- Data on Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)

## Study population

This retrospective cohort study will analyse the cohort of individuals
living with CKD 4/5 on 01/03/2022 (the **‘index date’**), and then
follow up their prescriptions for the following 4 years.

### Inclusion criteria

Individuals will be included in the cohort if on the index date they
meet all the following criteria:

- Alive
- Aged ≥18 and ≤110 years
- Continuous registration at a single GP practice that uses TPP software
  for at least the one year prior.
- Evidence of advanced chronic kidney disease, confirmed by the presence
  of one or both of the following (9):
  - The two most recent, plausible serum creatinine measurements that
    are \>90 days apart are consistent with an estimated glomerular
    filtration rate (eGFR) \<30 mls/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> (calculated
    using the 2009 CKD-EPI equation as recommended by the [UK Kidney
    Association](https://www.ukkidney.org/health-professionals/information-resources/uk-eckd-guide/measurement-kidney-function)).
  - A prior SNOMED code indicating a diagnosis of CKD, with the most
    recent stage being CKD 4 and 5
- Known sex that is exactly ‘male’ or ‘female’
- Known region
- Known IMD

### Exclusion criteria

- People in receipt of kidney replacement therapy (KRT). This is defined
  as a code indicating dialysis or transplant prior to the index date,
  or on the index date itself. This method has been shown to be
  sensitive for identifying the prevalent KRT population in England
  (10).

### Follow up

Study participants will be followed up from the index date until the
earliest of:

- End of maximum follow up period (4 years)
- Death
- Initiation of kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or transplant)
- End of registration with GP practice that uses TPP software

### Data quality assurance criteria

We will remove patients whose data fails quality assurance checks: -
Remove patients whose year of birth is missing - Remove patients whose
year of birth after year of death - Remove patients whose date of death
is after today - Remove patients whose year of birth is after today

## Prescribing information

### Prescribing data

In this analysis we will study baseline prescribing on the index date,
and the trends of medication discontinuation over time.

The medication table within OpenSAFELY-TPP contains information for
every medication that is prescribed in primary care. Each prescription
is recorded using its corresponding NHS dictionary of medicines and
devices (dm+d) code and corresponding date. [dm+d
codes](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/governance/latest-activity/standards-and-collections/scci0052-dictionary-of-medicines-and-devices-dm-d/)
are the preferred mechanism through which medicinal product
identification and communication occurs within the NHS. In OpenSAFELY,
each dm+d code corresponds to the name (e.g. atorvastatin), strength
(e.g. 40mg) and formulation (e.g. tablet) of a prescribed drug. Data on
the dosing recommendation (e.g. take 1 tablet once a day), the quantity
of a medication prescribed (e.g. 28 tablets), whether a prescription was
dispensed, or whether the patient adhered to the medication as
prescribed are not available.

### Prescribing data handling

Each dm+d code has one or more official routes of administration and
these will be mapped to the study data using publicly available [NHS
TRUD](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud/users/guest/filters/0/categories/6)
(Technology Reference data Update Distribution) reference files. Each of
the 79 official routes of administration will be mapped according to
author consensus to one of the following categories: oral, topical,
inhaled, eye/ear/nasal, oromucosal, rectal/vaginal, transdermal,
intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous and other. If a dm+d code has
multiple licensed routes it will be classified ‘multiple routes’, and if
no licensed routes, ‘unknown’.

Each medication will then have its dm+d code mapped to its corresponding
British National Formulary (BNF) substance code using publicly available
[mapping
data](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/prescription-data/understanding-our-data/bnf-snomed-mapping).
BNF codes follow a clear hierarchical structure and allow for clinically
meaningful analysis.

### Medication inclusion / exclusion criteria

Medicines will be included / excluded in our analysis by considering
their *scope, uniqueness and timeframe* (11).

#### Scope

We will include medications based on their drug type and route.

- Drug type. We will include medications within BNF chapters 1, 2, 3, 4,
  6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. These chapters, mirroring those used by the
  [NHSBSA medicines
  optimisation](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/access-our-data-products/epact2/dashboards-and-specifications/medicines-optimisation-polypharmacy)
  dashboards, include the medicines that are most likely to be oral, and
  therefore contributing to pill burden and medication harm. Excluded
  BNF chapters include mainly non-oral,specialist products and devices
  that are unlikely to be targets for discontinuation.
- Route. We will only include medications that are orally administered.

It will not be possible to distinguish PRN (as required) prescriptions
from regular prescriptions, and so all medications will be assumed
regular.

#### Uniqueness

Combination products have distinct dm+d and BNF substance codes and so
will be counted as a single drug.

#### Timeframe

Conceptually, for a medicine to be discontinued, it must be first in
*chronic* use, i.e. being used on the index date, and regularly prior to
that. There is no consensus regarding how to define a chronic
prescription within electronic health record data. OpenSAFELY-TPP lacks
data to show the clinician-intended duration for each prescription, and
therefore assumptions about the length of each prescription are required
to establish what a person could have been taking on any given date. It
has previously been shown that for five of the commonest medicines, 92%
were prescribed for 28 or 56 days, with the remainder being prescribed
for 7 or 84 days (12).

Considering this variability, we will define a medication as chronic,
and include it in our analyses, if all of the following are true:

- In the 180 days prior to the index date:
  - It is prescribed two or more times (*regular*)
  - There are \>=21 days between the oldest and the most recent
    prescriptions (*sustained*)
- In the 90 days prior to the index date:
  - It is prescribed once or more (*recent*)

## Outcome - medication discontinuation

Medications prescribed at baseline will be followed longitudinally for
up to 4 years to examine patterns of discontinuation.

Within OpenSAFELY-TPP the duration of each prescription is unknown, and
there is no standardised way of defined discontinuation within
electronic healthcare record data.

In this study, we will firstly calculate the average prescription
duration (APD).

Every medication for every individual will be placed into a category
based on whether it appears to be prescribed every 7, 14, 28, 56, or 84
days – the typical prescribing durations in English primary care (12).
The APD will be the average gap length between prescriptions for each
person-medicine prior to the index date, rounded to the nearest of 7,
14, 28, 56, or 84.

Discontinuation post index date will then be defined as:

- *A gap between prescriptions \> APD + 60 days*

And the date of discontinuation will be defined as:

- *The date of the last prescription before discontinuation + APD*

Sensitivity analyses will explore the effect of not including an APD,
and varying the length of gap required to define discontinuation.

## Covariates

Covariates have been chosen for two different reasons:

- It is hypothesised that they will likely have an impact on medication
  discontinuation.
- To promote analytical inclusivity, by exploring variations by
  protected characteristics.

Covariates, which will be defined on the index date, are described in
the table below.

## Statistical methods

### Cohort characteristics

We will produce a flowchart to show the numbers of individuals that are
included / excluded at each stage of cohort development. Descriptive
statistics will be used to describe this group’s baseline
characteristics split based on whether they are living with CKD G4 of
CKD G5: mean, median and measure of variance for continuous variables,
and frequencies and proportions for categorical variables.

### Baseline prescribing

We will present:

1.  The average total number of prescribed medications per person on the
    index date, and
2.  The proportions of the population prescribed each of the most common
    categories of medication (grouped by BNF subchapter).

We will explore the associations between age, sex, ethnicity and
deprivation and the total number of prescribed medications on the index
date by univariable stratification.

### Medication discontinuation

Competing events:

- Death (all-cause)
- Initiation of kidney replacement therapy

#### Cumulative incidence of discontinuation

For each of the studied medication classes, cumulative incidence
functions (CIFs) for medication discontinuation over the follow-up
period will be plotted. These will model death and the initiation of KRT
as competing events.

### Software

All analyses will be run using the OpenSAFELY Data Analytics Platform.
Data extraction scripts will be written using the electronic health
record query language (ehrQL), and data processing and analysis scripts
will be written using R. OpenSAFELY tightly controls the version of R
(4.4.3) and the the available packages that can be
[used](https://github.com/opensafely-core/r-docker/blob/main/v2/packages.md)
in order to maximise reproducibility of code, and to enable local
testing.

### Sensitivity analyses

Sensitivity analyses will explore the effect of:

- Including drugs that are administered through other routes.
- Varying the definition of a chronic medicines (using different
  numbers/timeframes of prescriptions).
- Varying the definition of medication discontinuation.
